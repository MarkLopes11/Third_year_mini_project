I got a DM from a mega Genshin Impact whale. And when I say mega, I mean mega. They have spent over US$100,000. Yeah. On this Genjin Impact account. I even asked them, how much do you play? They play about two to three hours per day. They are not just a whale, but they're also a completionist. They like to complete every single thing that this free to play gotcha game has to offer. Honestly, at this point, I might think that this person funds Hoyo. We wouldn't have Genshin Impact without them. Thanks for your Service and spending $100,000. If you remember, a long time ago, I did review someone's account. This is the same person. I thought it was insane. So we're gonna review them again and see what progress they have made. And see if this might be the most perfect Genshin Impact account to ever exist. All right, off the rip. The team that they use are Neuvillette, Furina, Kazua and Zhongli. Let's just take a look at this team that they have right now. Neuvillette, level 90. 47,000 HP. 55 for 308 crit damage. Flat on the dot. Jesus Christ. Okay. His weapon Tome of the Eternal flow at level 90 R5. Four piece Maru chase. That gives you more crit rate as your HP increases and decreases. Perfect for him. That 55 turns into something more. All right, let's take a look at these artifacts real quick. Okay. 10.9 crit rate. 6.2 crit damage, some defense and HP. 14% HP. Not bad. All right. Hey bro. Okay. Oh my God. That goblet though. That's like. That's a 40C. A lot of HP on here too. Constellation. Of course. Let's see. 6, 13, 9, 12. Dear God. All right. Furina. Level 90. 40,000 HP. God damn. 97.7. 227.6 crit damage per weapon at level 90R5. Four piece golden troop. Let's see here. My God. Okay. Dear God. Okay. All right. Okay. C6. Because. Why not? Of course it's C6 and 9. 12. 12 kazwa level 91,006 em. 172 er. His weapon, level 90 R5. Why not four piece VV. Perfect. Let's take a look here and see. 61 em. 72 ems on er. On there. Nice em. Em. 18.8 energy recharge. Nice em. 16.2 er. Not bad. C6 of course. 10, 13, 13. All right. Zhongli. Level 90. 39,000 hp. Okay. 65 over 130. Crit rate. Crit damage. Okay. 111 energy recharge. Oh dude. Do you know how insane that would have been to see a level 90 R5 vortex vanquisher? I mean I feel like an R2. That's already a lot. Or be senacity. All right. God damn. Okay. It's like a hybrid Zhongli is what it looks like. Of course. C6. 9 12. 12. God damn. That is a team. What would you rate that team on a scale of 0 to 1 million whale out of 10? Yeah, for sure. Okay. First and foremost, I just gotta show you guys this. I think they have every character in this game. Let's see how many are level 90 so far? Every single one. Even Aloy. This is how you know they are dedicated. Chat a level 90 aloy. Oh my God. Every character is at level 90. Every single one of them. Dory even Holy. Let's see how many characters they have. C6. Okay. Chiori is not level. It's not C6. All right. Back to it. All right. Albedo 3. Okay. Wanderer. Xiao. I'm not even mad about that. Xiao Venti. Okay. Imagine not having a C6. Aloy. If a C6 eula though gone you not C6. All right. Dear God. Emily's not C6. Baizhu. All right. Tainar. Well, Tainari. You have to lose the 5050 too. So Nilou's not C6. All right. We're at 10 non C6 characters right now. 11 based. Hu. Okay. Klee. C6 Bennett based. If I counted correctly, they have 14 non C6 characters. They said Alhaitham was their worst C6 R5 worst pulls of my life. 2,400 wishes wild. Let's look at talents real quick. God damn. Jesus Christ. Dude. This is already more than me. Even Aloysa. 999. Oh my God. In my opinion, this is even more impressive than having multiple C6 characters. Because this takes dedication. Oh my God. Bro, Chill. Jesus Christ. The amount of mora this probably takes and the amount of resin this takes is insane. I don't think I checked this last time. Friendship levels. Let's take a look. And this is to go even further beyond Holy. Even Aloy. I. Wait. Someone said more friends than me? What the. I think this is a dev count. Bro. All of them are like level 90. Oh my God. They have 241 weapons. So this is basically a Pokedex of every weapon in the game at max level as you scroll down. Wait. You have every weapon in the game and you're telling me that they are all level 90? Almost all the four stars are R52. What did he say? What the. Oh my God. Okay. And then it gets here to. Wait.

This is the number one account in all Genshin. Impact has everything. Let's take a look at their achievements. They are AR60, world level 8, 1239. How many achievements are in Genshin? There are 1241. And you have 1239. There's technically 1212 40. The last Imaginarium Theater achievement isn't obtainable yet. That is insane, dude. 1001-001001-00100,'100, 100. Everything's 100. Holy. Aha. It's this one. This is the last one you need to do. Yeah. We can't do this until the third iteration of the theater. Then you will have every single achievement. Two things. What was the worst achievement to get. And two. Was it worth getting all the achievements? This is actually something that I would like to attempt to do. Keyword. Zoom in on this when you're editing this. Turtle attempt. Perfect. The worst achievements are fishing 2000 fish and also growing plants in the teapot. You heard it here. Chat. Those are the two worst achievements in Genshin Impact. Coming from someone who has every single achievement known to man in Genshin. Purveyor of punishment. Look it up. The purveyor of punishment. Oh. He wanted to see what their max damage was. Their max damage is. 4,682,597. Who'd you do that with? It is Eula. That is insanely impressive coming from someone who is really bad at exploring. Let's see your exploration. Okay, cool. 100%. 100%. Look at that. I almost forgot. 100% percent. 100%. 100%. 100%. Okay, that's. That's great. What about the desert? The desert. Everybody hates this. Oh, I spoke. 100%. 100%. 100%. There's going to be literally something that's not 100%. 100%. 100%. 100. Dragon Spine. 100. Okay, what about over here? 1001-001001-00100. 100. You know what? Let me check your quest log real quick. Let's see if you've done a request. Let's see. Hey. Yo. What the. Oh, my God. And you got all the endings for each of them. All endings reached. All endings reached. Chad is saying to check your name cards. Oh, my God. So. Name cards. I missed battle pass 1.0 to 1.6, but I have everything else. I'm guessing you just weren't playing during that time. Did you claim all your mail? Bro's got no mail. It's. It's gone. I want to try out this K. This, this, this, this, this team. Real quick chat. Let the world come solidify. What the. Wait, wait, Wait a second. Did. Did I glitch the game? I glitched the game. Where? It was Neuvillette doing Zhongli's meatball bro. What the. Also. Wait, hold on. She's dead. What the. How. Dude, how fast was that? Wait, let's go look at the TCG cards. And you know what? While we're here, we'll also look at the cooking pot. Okay, so this is the second biggest surprise. So this is all 196 recipes in the game. Also cooked to max proficiency. Every single one. You are literally the master chef. Gordon Ramsay would be Proud. Finally. It's a good. What the is this? Blubber cream. I have never seen that before. That's what they call me back in college. Lana, shut the up. This might be the scariest account. I don't deserve to be on this account. Why am I touching this account? Yeah, I'm here to take a look at the cards. Player level maxed unlocked character cards. 95 collected action cards. All 614 open world match challenge objectives reach 265. Oh, my God, bro. What the genin saw your account and they're like, this mother plays the TCG a lot. Dway. Do you think that people like the tcg? Yeah, I mean, this guy likes it. And then that's why we have the TCG Turn tournaments now because of you. Zed said so. I actually don't like tcg. A true completionist does it. Even if they hate it. They are a true completionist. All right, archive. This is what I would expect you to know the least about. Most players don't care about it. To me, it's kind of a magnum opus. I have every entry completed in it, which is probably the most difficult thing in the game to do, but it's also the most esoteric. Okay, I know that Zett is rich as and has some really amazing job because they're using some words that I have. I don't have no idea what they even mean. What the does esoteric mean? I dropped out of college and I'm a streamer. Some of it's very esoteric to me and benign, really, but, you know, let's take a look and see. You have 25, 69 entries unlocked. That is the max number of entries obtainable. Got it. Okay. Living beings. Okay. Yo. Every living being. Of course, bro. I'm gonna be real with you. I didn't even know there was a crow in this game. I don't think I've ever seen this bird in the game, man. Okay, thank you. There are people in chat that are on my side. Where are the crows? They're in Inazuma. I didn't know that. Geography. Yeah, obviously you have everything because you have 100 completion literally everywhere. How would you not have all this st. Oh, these are the places that you, like, take like the little photos at, right? Do you. Wait, do you have every book in the game? You have literally all the entries unlocked. That means you do have every book. Materials. Yeah, no, they got everything, bro. They got everything on this account. Okay, that. That's. They have ever. Wow. Let me check your wing Glider real quick. Okay. Of course you have all of them. You even have the new ones. These ones that you can only get from a code. I have these ones too. I got lucky a viewer give them to me. Yeah, you got all the wings we know. Are these the dragons playing wings? They're so pretty, bro. Let's check out their traveler. Maybe. Maybe chat. Maybe they don't have every single one. Let's see. Resonate with animal nine. 1212. Yep. God damn. God damn, dude. Of course. Oh my God. Jesus Christ. If you want to play test any teams, all of those characters in there will be built and ready to go. While I use every character, I also leave a lot character artifact less. Only my heroes that have builds that I'm satisfied with have artifacts. Otherwise I just use the new auto equip when I get itchy to play other heroes. The account has over 1600 level 20 artifacts, so there's plenty to build from. The woman was too stunned to speak. I hate Bennett. Let's. Let's take a look on this. This team Rio Farina Bennett Shangling. Deploy it. Let's. What the was that? Oh my God. Holy. He went boom. I uppercutted her and just to oblivion. She died. That wriothesley is insane. I need to look at this character right now. I need to see your Rio because. Holy. 2200 attack. 65.9. Over. 222.9 crit damage 118 energy. Recharge his weapon at level 90 or r5. Okay. Okay. Oh, elemental mastery there. Okay. Oh, nice. Oh, that cryo damage bonus. Oh my God. 14.0 and 14.0 crit rate. Crit damage. My OCD. I love it. 15.2. Oh my God. Dude. C6. 13. 10. 13. Holy that Riley Max. Let's check out the next team Fontaine Femmes. Let's see how this one goes. Wait. What the. Oh my God. What the. Jesus. All right, let's try this team. Oh, they're yoing me out. Chat. Oh, I'm excited to try this one out. Actually. I'm very excited for this one. Here comes the firework. Solidified destruction. Only emptiness that is like a machine gun. Just like next team Arino Chevro Fishel yo. Justice will prevail. Overruled. You lying here. I mean, dude, I. I literally just can't like. It's like it's so fast. I don't even know the happened. Dude, just like you just destroy things. I didn't even get to try out y Miko Burst. I kind of want to try that out. God damn. This is a main dps. Coco. Go, go, go. I don't even know what happened. Coco could have been doing nothing. Coco could have been doing something at this point. Who cares? She died. And it was fast as and that was hilarious. This one's called where is Ca to shine. Shower me with this process of elimination. Oh my God. What the was that? That was so disgusting. That team was especially cracked. Why is this one called 100% crit rate? Does your ITO have 100 crit rate? Oh my God. All right. Stabilize control in everyone on. It's show time. Atta boy. God damn. We'll have order. The ey sweeps the land only emptiness away. Shiori hit 105k burst and 48k with each hit. What was Ito hidden? I. I wasn't even looking, dude. He was just bonk bonk, bonk, bonk bonk. Just chunks were going away. Why did I see this team is literally called why did I c6 her? What do you mean? Are you not happy that you C6 her? I'll take her off your hands, bro. All right. Last team that they built for us. Let's see it. You're such a. You're such a. I got to do that again. Oh, she blocked it, bro. She said no. I am the better Raiden. I'm gonna try this again. See how this goes. Illusion Shatter Thunder. The thunder. Oh, that's it. That's it. That's it. I'm gonna go fight the tea guy. That's what I'm gonna do now. You shall perish. Oh, oh, oh. Oh. Leave me alone, please. You know, this is skill issue, Chat. I. I admit it. It's a skill issue. It's a skill issue. It's a skill issue. It's a skill issue. Okay. I'm really bad on this team. I don't care. Zed says I'm not good at that team either. Let's copium together. It's the the team. It's not us as the player. It's the team. It's not really a great team, you know. No. Hate to you. You built the team very well. Meta wise and stuff like that. This team ain't really doing it, you know. Forget about it. You know. Also, can we talk about this real quick? Their highest CV is 48.2. It's this bard's arrow feather. 17.1. Crit rate. 14. 14.0. Crit damage. I beat him. I beat chat. I beat him. 48.2. Suck it. 49.7. It's still not 50 CV though.

Wait, wait, wait. No way. I can't do math. I'm a streamer and I dropped out of college. 101.2 times 2. 202 point. That's what it says. That you literally have the perfect one to two ratio. I've never seen that before. Oh my God, that's so. Oh, my brain feels good after seeing that one. All right, let's take a look here and see. How do we get there? Thundering pulse level 90R5. Okay, that's correct. Scorpius shimenawa, obviously. Let's take a look and see. God damn. That's a great flower right there. God. 19.4 crit rate, some crit damage, some attack and some er. God damn, bro. 16.3 crit rate on that one. Then crit rate circulate. 26.4 crit damage. Emer flat attack. Of course it's C6. Why not? You know, 10, 13 and 12. I think I peed myself a little bit.

So that is Zetorix's account in Genshin Impact. When I reviewed them a long time ago, I was like man this is amazing. I didn't think it get any better. I was wrong. This was the most insane account I've ever seen. And get Genshin impact, dude. Over $100,000 spent. But not just that. Playing every single day to get every achievement, all friendship levels up, every character level 90. Your archive is maxed out map. Like everything is just like. This is like better than a dev account at this point, bro. Yo, the dedication is wild and I love to see it because it shows that you really love this game. I want to say from the bottom of my heart, thank you so much for solely funding Genshin Impact. You are the reason why we still have this game around. Probably. Dude. I had to rate count. I'd probably say like a like 40 million out of 10. Bro. There's no way. It's just like insane. We're filming this the day of Natlan release. Zettorix is going to have some new content for themselves.
