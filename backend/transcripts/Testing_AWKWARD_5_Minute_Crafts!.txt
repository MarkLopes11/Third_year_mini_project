I already don't want to help you. If you want this cup of whatever the heck we're about to put in it, you're gonna have to address me by my God given name. Papa. What are you doing with the cup? Well, I've seen this before. Oh, you put rice in it. Comforting hand. Yeah, I wouldn't want to touch my kids either. Gross human connection. I'd rather not. That's the end of it. Oh, shoo. I don't have to touch him. Gross kids, am I right? Can't live with them kids. I got jasmine white rice and brown rice. Depending on which hand I want to make me or my girlfriend. My kid is half and half, so I'm just gonna pour both. This is causing me stress. It went in my shoe. Daddy's here and so is mommy. Nana, Nana, boo boo. Mommy doesn't want to touch you. It's not a direct rhyme, but I think he'll get the point. Put a little bit more white daddy in there. Cool. No gang signs. Thank God she went unconscious or I'd have to talk to her. This way. If the police ever come. No, that's not a good sentence to stop on. As I was saying, stay awake. If the cops ever come and say, hey, putting hands on your. On your kid. I am not. No. Now, if you were to ask me, am I throwing latex gloves full of hard rice, Yes, I am. I will not lie to you. You know what? I don't think you need both of them. You know what? Do you? I don't know. Maybe your baby likes to David Coppelfil and drink. I don't. I know I do. David Coppil. Um, funny. Okay, you're struggling to put diapers on. I get it. I do it all the time. Holy crap, you got the pants on. You know how hard it is to put a diaper on an 11 month old? Okay, without ever touching him. Let me just go ahead and recreate how this would go. I'm crying now. My face hurts with these powerful ogre hands and puts me on my hands and knees. That doesn't work. Okay, maybe don't show your kid Shrek is love. Shrek is life. Unless you want to traumatize them. But then again, you're not actually touching them with your own hands, so you don't really care about that, do you? Hold this, Kelly. Oh, Overactor. Pepto Dopoop. Okay, out in public, poop in public. Whatever happened to hey, hold it till we get home? Why would you even. Just bring the bag? Just Poop in the. Just stick your legs in. Hold on. Okay, maybe don't make it into a. How many eggs are in there? Oh, my gosh. I need to see a doctor or a farmer. I've decided not to put my pants back on. So poop mama. Such a mama's boy. You're pooping in the park. You're pooping with your jeans on. And pooping grapes. Be honest with me. Are you spoonful in relish into your kid's mouth and wait, do you. You brought your own trash can? So you'll touch the poop, but you won't touch me? Him. You won't touch him. Video, Right? My mother touches me a lot. I immediately regretted that. My mother loves me. Okay, tell them. How's dad doing? Dad. Kelly, look, Grandpa's here. She can't believe it either. You are embarrassing my father in front of me. Kelly. Sorry, dad. Where'd you go? It's cold in here. There must be some chunky breast milk in the m as well. Hmm, good idea. I normally just put mine in the warmest part of my body. My heart. Oop. Nope. That's where the relish goes. You gotta know how to drink it. Would you like a sip of Daddy's spicy water? Hold on, you got a little bit on your. I'm sorry, did I spit directly in your eyeball? How's that? Pretty foggy. Yeah, it's gonna be like that for a bit. That's pretty spicy, huh, Daddy? Spicy water got in your eyes. Sorry about that. Daddy normally doesn't drink before 2, but luckily for me, it's 2:30, so. Yeah, I have done a good job. You're right. No, no. Okay, so you put house windows on a truck. I like it. This kid's gonna be an engineer one day. Not of trucks or houses. Oh, she hates it. Oh, I did the same thing. I'm just as bad as you. You might as well just fill these hands with rice because I am just a horrible mother. Trace this. So you're not bad anymore. You know what? Let kids be kids. Let him do a house window on a truck if he wants to. Holy crap. That's a lot better than last time. Yeah, man. Do that. Whatever you're gonna do with that giant needle. Isn't it okay if plastic spoon doesn't work and you went for needle wrong way. Okay, you're going. Here's the line. You've crossed it. You gotta bribe them. Okay, I'll rub your back with my real hand if you let me spoonful this stuff. And how did you do it? You shoved it in a marshmallow. That's pretty. Good idea. Just hype them up full of sugar. Cause sugar does help kill diseases. Okay, now I'm preaching. Okay. Can't open the door to the outside. Make it easier for them. There you go. Yeah, so you can wreak havoc wherever you want. Your shoes are on backwards. Whoa. Ooh. Next. Push me, Mom. I wanna go to Grandma's. Oh, you're stressed now, Mom. No, no, no. Don't touch him. 10 bucks says he makes it. Let me hold a doll. Wasn't the portable waterboard in your kid? It's over the mouth. I filled mine with pancake mix. Ugh. You've aged. I've forgotten why I was even stressed in the first place. You know what? No worries. We'll just make pancakes out of it once dad gets back from the store with the milk. Can you make me a sandwich?
